# P1.2 RPI Image

The goal of this step is to use BuildRoot to compile and flash a micro SD with a kernel we built. This will allow us to change kernel source and to compile kernel modules. We will use our [MEME OS 1](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/MEME_OS) as a starting point as we have some useful scripts to facilitate the dev process

# Kernel Build ENV set up

```bash

```
